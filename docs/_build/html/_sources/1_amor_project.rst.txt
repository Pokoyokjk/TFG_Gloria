The AMOR (*An√°lisis de sentimiento MORal en datos textuales* -Spanish- or Moral Sentiment Analysis in Textual Data) 
Project aims to develop **critical thinking** and the ability to manage one's emotions 
when engaging with media and social networks, in order to combat phenomena 
such as **disinformation**, **hate speech**, and **clickbait**.

The general objectives of the project are defined around its strategic lines, as follows:

#. Research semantic text analysis techniques that facilitate cooperative processing in the cloud and at the edge.

#. Investigate the analysis and application of moral and ethical values, including their auditing.

#. Explore new visualization techniques and immersive interaction that make effective use of textual data analysis.

This includes the development of sector-specific applications that promote social awareness on issues such as rural depopulation, the risk of radicalization among vulnerable groups, and the needs of the elderly and dependent individuals.
