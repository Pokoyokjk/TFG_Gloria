# SEGB Ontology

This repository contains the **SEGB** ontology, designed to model [brief description of the ontology's purpose, if applicable]. Below is an overview of the main files and folders in the project:

## Repository Contents

- **`segb.ttl`**: The main file defining the SEGB ontology in Turtle format.
- **`example.ttl`**: A comprehensive example demonstrating the application of the SEGB ontology.
- **`doc/`**: A folder containing the documentation automatically generated using the [Widoco](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco) tool. It provides a detailed description of the ontology, its classes, properties, and more.
- **`queries/`**: A folder with SPARQL query examples that utilize the model defined in `segb.ttl` and the example data in `example.ttl`.

## Usage

1. **Explore the Ontology**: Open the `segb.ttl` file in your preferred RDF editor to review the structure and defined concepts. You can also access the ontology online at [https://www.gsi.upm.es/ontologies/segb/ns/](https://www.gsi.upm.es/ontologies/segb/ns/).
2. **Practical Example**: Refer to the `example.ttl` file to see how the ontology is applied in a practical scenario. You can also explore additional examples online at [https://www.gsi.upm.es/ontologies/segb/examples](https://www.gsi.upm.es/ontologies/segb/examples).
3. **Documentation**: Check the `doc/` folder for a detailed description of the ontology.
4. **SPARQL Queries**: Use the examples in the `queries/` folder as a starting point for querying data that follows the SEGB model. To execute these queries, load the `example.ttl` file as the data source. Additionally, the `sparqlbook` file is designed to be used with the [SPARQL Notebook](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=Zazuko.sparql-notebook) extension for Visual Studio Code.
